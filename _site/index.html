<h1 id="tvrr-projects">TVRR projects</h1>

<p>TVRR is actively fighting to address severe deficiencies in roadway design through vigils (as highlighted in this <a href="https://oaklandside.org/2022/10/20/traffic-violence-rapid-response-team-oakland/">newspiece</a>) as well as policy changes in the way Oakland approaches roadway design and priortization of traffic modes. A few key projects are listed below.</p>

<h3 id="oakdot-funding-fy23-25">OakDOT funding FY23-25</h3>

<p>The International BRT lanes are unsafe and, frankly, incomplete in their current form.

As of December 2022, Oakland has <a href="https://twitter.com/RapidRevolt/status/1602398196218462208">allocated funds</a> to rapidly deploy pedestrian safety interventions along Oakland’s deadliest road.</p>
